# 1:47pm - after lunch break -> start reading problem statement
# 1:51pm - ~4 minutes to read and come up with game plan

# game plan: top-down DP, track current i,j and let k be the amount of continuous hops in the same direction, each next state is left,right,straight
# and straight is only allowed if k < 3


# 1:53pm - start implementation
# 1:57pm - implementation done, let's see what happens...
# 2:09pm - debugging...
# 2:24pm - ok I think I need to start over again, LOL -- the DFS is returning a sub-optimal solution because of the cache
#          and the cache is needed to avoid this thing taking forever!  So this has a funky smell, and I don't like it one bit
#          instead let's use BFS queue, then +1,+2,+3 in same direction, +1 left and +1 right to each potential next step, tracking
#          coordinate values in the queue which have been seen

# queue element can be i,j cell and total to reach it
# seen can be set of seen i,j cells -> we can perform a scan of the matrix in M*N time

# I think that sounds like a better game plan, let's take a break and come back...
# question: how to enforce the 3 in the same direction rule? +onto the queue element the last_i, last_j, and step count ?
# then we can derive the +1 step for steps in the same direction
