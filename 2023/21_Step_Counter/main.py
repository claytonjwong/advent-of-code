# 9:12am - read problem statement

# game plan:

# kinda lame to see BFS again... same old same old is getting boring, but whatever, let's jam!

# 9:14am - implementation begins
# so I need to track if the steps away from origin are evenly divisible by the number of steps
# ok write distance function and write ok function if distance is evenly divisible

# 9:25am - implementation ended a few minutes ago and automatically
#          logical reasoning + debugging begins, my count of seen is higher than expected ðŸ‘» (I see 21 but expect 16)

# 9:45am - oops, ok my ok function was incorrect, instead of taking into account even divisibility, we just need to
#          check if both are even or odd, since we could potentially hop back-and-forth an even amount of steps,
#          ie. 0,2,4,6,etc,steps away are all ok with an even amount of steps from the origin
#              1,3,5,7,etc,steps away are all ok with an odd amount of steps from the origin
# 9:47am - part 1 accpted, yay! ðŸ™‚
